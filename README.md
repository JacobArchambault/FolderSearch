# FolderSearch
A file I/O application recursively copying files to an output directory based on user prompts for filters by date, regex pattern, number of files to match per subdirectory. The application uses a decorator pattern, with heavy use of dependency injection and multiple implementations of a common interface to allow various filters to be added on based on user prompts before recursively copying the files from a user-specied source directory to a user-specified output directory.
